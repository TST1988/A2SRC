prove that the frequency responses of the cardinal spline filters converge to the ideal lowpass filter in all Lfnorms with 
1 ~<p < + ~ as the order of the spline tends to infinity. We provide estimates for the resolution errors and the interpolation 
errors of the various filters. We also derive an upper bound for the error associated with the reconstruction of bandlimited 
signals using polynomial splines.},

  Review                   = {Image interpolation techniques often are required
in medical imaging for image generation (e.g., discrete back
projection for inverse Radon transform) and processing such as
compression or resampling. Since the ideal interpolation function
spatially is unlimited, several interpolation kernels of finite size
have been introduced. This paper compares 1) truncated and win-
dowed sinc; 2) nearest neighbor; 3) linear; 4) quadratic; 5) cubic
B-spline; 6) cubic; g) Lagrange; and 7) Gaussian interpolation
and approximation techniques with kernel sizes from 1 ? 1 up to
8 ? 8. The comparison is done by: 1) spatial and Fourier analyses;
2) computational complexity as well as runtime evaluations; and
3) qualitative and quantitative interpolation error determinations
for particular interpolation tasks which were taken from common
situations in medical image processing.

For local and Fourier analyses, a standardized notation is intro-
duced and fundamental properties of interpolators are derived.
Successful methods should be direct current (DC)-constant and
interpolators rather than DC-inconstant or approximators. Each
methods parameters are tuned with respect to those properties.
This results in three novel kernels, which are introduced in this
paper and proven to be within the best choices for medical
image interpolation: the 6 ? 6 BlackmanHarris windowed sinc
interpolator, and the C2-continuous cubic kernels with N = 6
and N = 8 supporting points.

For quantitative error evaluations, a set of 50 direct digital
X rays was used. They have been selected arbitrarily from
clinical routine. In general, large kernel sizes were found to be
superior to small interpolation masks. Except for truncated sinc
interpolators, all kernels with N = 6 or larger sizes perform
significantly better than N = 2 or N = 3 point methods
(p ? 0:005). However, the differences within the group of large-
sized kernels were not significant. Summarizing the results, the
cubic 6 ? 6 interpolator with continuous second derivatives,
as defined in (24), can be recommended for most common
interpolation tasks. It appears to be the fastest six-point kernel
to implement computationally. It provides eminent local and
Fourier properties, is easy to implement, and has only small
errors. The same characteristics apply to B-spline interpolation,
but the 6 ? 6 cubic avoids the intrinsic border effects produced
by the B-spline technique.

However, the goal of this study was not to determine an
overall best method, but to present a comprehensive catalogue of
methods in a uniform terminology, to define general properties
and requirements of local techniques, and to enable the reader
to select that method which is optimal for his specific application
in medical imaging.},

  Abstract                 = {Fractional sample delay (FD) filters are useful and necessary in many applications, such as the accurate steering of acoustic arrays, delay lines for physical models of musical instruments, and time delay estimation. This paper addresses the design of finite impulse response (FIR) FD filters. The problem is posed as a convex optimization problem in which the maximum modulus of the complex error is minimized. Several design examples are presented, along with an empirical formula for the filter order required to meet a given worst case group delay error specification},
