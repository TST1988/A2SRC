Sample Rate converter from 48kHz to 44.1kHz.

USAGE:
$>python resample.py -i input.wav [-o output.wav -q [0.0-1.0]]

EXAMPLES:
$>python resample.py -i onades.wav
$>python resample.py -i onades.wav -o out.wav
$>python resample.py -i onades-mono.wav -q 0.8
$>python resample.py -i onades.wav -o out3.wav -q 0.5

DESCRIPTION:
The input has to be a WAV file sampled at 48 kHz/sec
with a resolution of 16 bits/sample. It can have n>0
number of channels (i.e. 1=mono, 2=stereo, ...).

The output will be a WAV file sampled at 44.1 kHz/sec
with a resolution of 16 bits/sample, and the same
number of channels as the input.

A quality parameter q can be provided (>0.0 to 1.0), and
it will modify the number of zero crossings of the filter, 
making the output quality best when q = 1.0 and very bad 
as q tends to 0.0

The sample rate factor is:

 44100     147
------- = ----- 
 48000     160
 
To do the conversion, we upsample by 147, low pass filter, 
and downsample by 160 (in this order). This is done by
using an efficient polyphase filter bank with resampling 
algorithm proposed by Vaidyanathan in [2].

The low pass filter is an impulse response windowed
by a Kaiser window to have a better filtering 
(around -60dB in the rejection band) [1].

As a comparison between the Kaiser Window and the
Rectangular Window, this algorithm plotted the following
images included with this package:

KaiserIR.png
KaiserFR.png
RectIR.png
RectFR.png

The images show the Impulse Responses and the Frequency
Responses of the Kaiser and Rectangular Windows. As it can be
clearly seen, the Kaiser window has a gain of around -60dB in the
rejection band, whereas the Rect window has a gain of around -20dB
and smoothly decreasing to -40dB. Thus, the Kaiser window
method is rejecting the aliasing much better than the Rect window.

The Filter Design is performed in the function:
designFIR()

The Upsampling, Filtering, and Downsampling is
performed in the function:
upSampleFilterDownSample()

Also included in the package are two wav files sampled at 48kHz
with 16bits/sample resolution. One is stereo and the other mono:

onades.wav
onades-mono.wav

NOTES:
You need numpy and scipy installed to run this script.
You can find them here:
http://numpy.scipy.org/

You may want to have matplotlib as well if you want to 
print the plots by yourself (commented right now)

This code would be much faster on C or C++, but my decision
on using Python was to make the code more readable (yet useful)
rather than focusing on performance.
